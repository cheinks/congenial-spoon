Bubble sort:
Compares two, the greater one is moved down the list.
After every iteration, the last item of the list is guaranteed to be sorted.

Insertion sort:
Moves through the list, creating a sorted and unsorted section.
Compares the first unsorted to every item before it (until it would be sorted).

Selection sort:
"Selects" the lowest value in the list and moves it to the front.
Guarantees the next item of the list is sorted.
